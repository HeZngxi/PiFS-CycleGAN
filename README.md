# PiFS-CycleGAN
This repository contains the official implementation for the paper "Physics-Informed and Frequency-Enhanced CT to EUS Synthesis with High Structural Fidelity". We propose PiFS-CycleGAN, a novel framework for translating preoperative Computed Tomography (CT) images into high-fidelity Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) images.
